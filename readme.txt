This folder contains the completed R tasks for Michael Finnegan's candidacy for the Statistician/Econometrician position at AIR.

The r script titled 'air.R' contains my responses to tasks 1 through 5.

Task 6, which asked me to create a minimal Shiny application, can be found in the folder titled 'Shiny'. In that folder there is an R script, 'app.R', and a dataset titled 'balanced.csv'. This csv file is a balanced panel dataset that contains enrollment, grant aid, and price information for all undergraduate institutions in Tennessee from years 2010 to 2015. This is the dataset used in the Shiny app. 

As long as 'app.R' and 'balanced.csv' are kept in that Shiny folder then, upon opening 'app.R' and clicking "run app", the Shiny app should run without any errors.
